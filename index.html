                        </div>
                        <p class="justify">I began working at LASP as a part-time undergraduate database developer during the Spring 2023 semester, transitioning to full-time during the summer, then returning
                            to part-time work for the Fall 2023 semester. Most of my time working at LASP has been spent working on the development of two repositories of administrative bash scripts
                            that perform various administrative tasks for PostgreSQL databases, Oracle databases, and AWS services. These scripts range widely in complexity from the straightforward task 
                            of printing all running databases on a linux server to navitating the intricacies of restoring a database from its recovery files created by a backup to a running database.
                            Through this work I've gained an extensive understandng of linux and bash. In addition to sharpening my Linux and bash skills, my LASP experience has provided me with valuable 
                            expertise in managing PostgreSQL and Oracle databases, along with a solid grasp of fundamental Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) concepts. Furthermore, I was 
                            introduced to AWS services such as S3 and EC2 and wrote bash scripts to automate AWS tasks such as creating S3 access points and managing IAM users and roles. I have since dove 
                            further into my work with AWS by shifting my primary focus to various AWS CDK applications. This shift enabled me to amass a wealth of experience in configuring services like S3, 
                            EC2, Lambda, DynamoDB, and more using AWS's Python CDK. Overall, this experience working at LASP has significantly enriched my development skills, equipping me with exceptional 
                            proficiency in Linux, bash scripting, RDBMS, and AWS technologies.

                    <p class="justify">I worked at Candela Corporation, a medical device company, as a remote IT intern. As a member of the cybersecurity team, 
                        I was tasked with analyzing employee phish rates to reduce the risk of data theft. From the weekly cybersecurity status calls I attended, 
                        I gathered the breadth of details I needed to make informed decisions about changing company policy. I identified trends in phish rate by 
                        department, country, and training completion utilizing Excel. Guided by this analysis, I curated a procedure to identify and notify high 
                        risk employees. I presented my findings to a member of the company’s executive leadership team with a slide deck containing relevant data. 
                        At the end of my internship, I met with management and several others I had worked with throughout the summer on business trip in Marlborough, 
                        Massachusetts. I walked team members through the process I created, helped prepare for the town hall event, and presented my findings and thoughts
                        to the company’s other interns and managers.

                    <p class="justify">GrandCanals is a shipping analytics company I worked at during the summer before my senior year of high school. I worked on a 
                        single project and saw it through to completion during the five weeks I spent there. I was tasked with writing a front-end interface for a 
                        page of their web app with the design having been provided by a UX designer. The interface allowed users to enter information about a shipment
                        such as size, weight, departure state, destination state, and departure date. With this form submitted, the user would then be shown the price 
                        of the shipment and the number of days needed to ship from point A to point B for each of the company's shipping priority options ("standard",
                        "expedited", "premium"). A graphic would also be displayed to the user displaying a map of the United States with a line connecting their
                        desired departure and destination states. The interface was written in HTML, CSS with Bootstrap 4, and JavaScript with JQuery. This was my 
                        first exposure to both Bootstrap and JQuery, making this experience a great growth opportunity for my front-end development skills.
