                    <p class="justify">I worked at Candela Corporation, a medical device company, as a remote IT intern. As a member of the cybersecurity team, 
                        I was tasked with analyzing employee phish rates to reduce the risk of data theft. From the weekly cybersecurity status calls I attended, 
                        I gathered the breadth of details I needed to make informed decisions about changing company policy. I identified trends in phish rate by 
                        department, country, and training completion utilizing Excel. Guided by this analysis, I curated a procedure to identify and notify high 
                        risk employees. I presented my findings to a member of the company’s executive leadership team with a slide deck containing relevant data. 
                        At the end of my internship, I met with management and several others I had worked with throughout the summer on business trip in Marlborough, 
                        Massachusetts. I walked team members through the process I created, helped prepare for the town hall event, and presented my findings and thoughts
                        to the company’s other interns and managers.

                    <p class="justify">GrandCanals is a shipping analytics company I worked at during the summer before my senior year of high school. I worked on a 
                        single project and saw it through to completion during the five weeks I spent there. I was tasked with writing a front-end interface for a 
                        page of their web app with the design having been provided by a UX designer. The interface allowed users to enter information about a shipment
                        such as size, weight, departure state, destination state, and departure date. With this form submitted, the user would then be shown the price 
                        of the shipment and the number of days needed to ship from point A to point B for each of the company's shipping priority options ("standard",
                        "expedited", "premium"). A graphic would also be displayed to the user displaying a map of the United States with a line connecting thier
                        desired departure and destination states. The interface was written in HTML, CSS with Bootstrap 4, and JavaScript with JQuery. This was my 
                        first exposure to both Bootstrap and JQuery, making this experience a great growth opportunity for my front-end development skills.

                        was to give our team experience with Agile software development. We also maintained a JIRA Kanban board that used to keep team organized and 
                        on track to complete our project in time. Our game was a Flappy Bird clone written in Unity using C#. The game was embedded into a website which
                        required the use/creation of login credentials to access. Each user's credentials and game high score was stored in a 
                        PostgreSQL database. I was responsible for writing the front-end HTML/CSS(Bootstrap)/JavaScript for the webpage, server-side node.js code that 
                        handled API calls to the PostgreSQL database and user web requests, and designing/configuring our PostgreSQL database. Our team also
                        used Docker for containerization of the node.js server and PostgreSQL database.
